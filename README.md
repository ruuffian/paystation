# paystation


This is tied as the most memorable lab that I did in college (the first being
implemented a shell in OS), despite it's relative simplicity. It very gracefully
introduces multiple complex OOP concepts in an easily digestible way. The 
original lab was done in Java, but I have decided to revisit it to teach myself 
C++ (and, apparently, CMake).


### Roadmap

* Cross-Platform compilation
* GNU Readline tui 
* ncurses tui
* openGL UI
